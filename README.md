# NFYU

Never Forget Your Umbrella is a sample iPhone app that demonstrates
 how you can develop a fully formed iOS application using Test-Driven
 Development in Swift.

NFYU uses OpenWeatherMap APIs to fetch the forcast data but is
 extensible to any other service. To do that, you can create and use
 a new class comforming to the WeatherDataSource protocol.

##Â Project Setup

This project comes with a shared OpenWeatherMap API Key stored in the
Xcode's NFYU configuration as environment varialble. You can use this
API Key but it would be best if you changed it to your own.

## TODO
